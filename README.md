##  Objectives  

1. **Database Setup**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issue status, and return status.  
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.  
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Generate summary tables using SQL.  
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Perform analytical queries to extract meaningful insights.  
5. **Reports**: Build queries to generate branch performance reports, overdue books reports, and revenue analysis.

## üèó Project Structure  

### 1. Database Setup  
- Created a database named `LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM`.  
- Designed tables for branches, employees, members, books, issue status, and return status.  
- Added relationships and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.  

### 2. CRUD Operations  
- Inserted sample records for books, employees, and members.  
- Performed updates .  
- Deleted records as required.  

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)  
- Built summary tables such as **Total Books Issued** and **Expensive Books** for reporting.  

### 4. Data Analysis & Reports  
- **Books Issued & Returned**: Track book availability.  
- **Overdue Books**: Identify overdue items and calculate fines.  
- **Branch Performance**: Evaluate branch activity and revenue.  
- **Employee Activity**: Identify employees handling the most book issues.  
- **Active Members**: Detect members who frequently borrow books.

##  Key Insights  

- **Members with small families of books borrowed frequently** tended to return more on time.  
- **Revenue generation varied across categories**, with classics and high-demand books performing well.  
- **Branch reports** provided insights into efficiency and workload distribution.  
- **Overdue tracking** enabled better fine collection and accountability.
