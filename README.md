```sql
SELECT ISSUED_BOOK_NAME,RS.ISSUED_ID 
FROM RETURN_STATUS RS
RIGHT JOIN ISSUED_STATUS IST 
ON RS.ISSUED_ID = IST.ISSUED_ID
WHERE RETURN_BOOK_ISBN IS NULL;

```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE RETURN_BOOKS_STATUS(P_RETURN_ID VARCHAR(15),P_ISSUED_ID VARCHAR(15),P_BOOK_QUALITY VARCHAR(15))
LANGUAGE PLPGSQL
AS $$
DECLARE 
V_ISSUED_ISBN VARCHAR(25);
V_BOOK_NAME VARCHAR(75);
BEGIN
SELECT ISSUED_BOOK_ISBN,ISSUED_BOOK_NAME
INTO V_ISSUED_ISBN,V_BOOK_NAME
FROM ISSUED_STATUS
WHERE ISSUED_ID=P_ISSUED_ID ;

INSERT 
  INTO RETURN_STATUS(RETURN_ID,ISSUED_ID,RETURN_DATE,BOOK_QUALITY)
  VALUES(P_RETURN_ID,P_ISSUED_ID,CURRENT_DATE,P_BOOK_QUALITY);

  B.BOOK_TITLE ,
COUNT(IST.ISSUED_BOOK_ISBN) AS HIGH_RISK_BOOKS
FROM ISSUED_STATUS IST
   LEFT JOIN RETURN_STATUS RS
ON IST.ISSUED_ID =RS.ISSUED_ID 
   JOIN MEMBERS M
ON M.MEMBER_ID=ISSUED_MEMBER_ID
   JOIN BOOKS B 
ON B.ISBN = IST.ISSUED_BOOK_ISBN 
   WHERE RS.BOOK_QUALITY ='Damaged'
GROUP BY 1,2
   HAVING count(RS.BOOK_QUALITY)>2;


```

**Task 19: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
-- all the variabable
    v_status VARCHAR(10);

BEGIN
-- all the code
    -- checking if book is available 'yes'
    SELECT 
        status 
        INTO
        v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES
        (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
            SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : %', p_issued_book_isbn;


    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
    END IF;
END;
$$

-- Testing The function
SELECT * FROM books;
-- "978-0-553-29698-2" -- yes
-- "978-0-375-41398-8" -- no
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8'

```



**Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS)**
Objective: Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.

Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 30 days. The table should include:
    The number of overdue books.
    The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50.
    The number of books issued by each member.
    The resulting table should show:
    Member ID
    Number of overdue books
    Total fines

```sql

 SELECT  M.member_id, 
	M.member_name, 
	COUNT(member_id) AS books_overdue,
	SUM((CURRENT_DATE - (iST.issued_date + INTERVAL '30 Days')::DATE) * 0.50) AS total_fines	--::DATE MAKES SURE IT RETURNS DATE TYPE
FROM members AS M
JOIN issued_status AS iST
	ON iST.issued_member_id = M.member_id
LEFT JOIN return_status AS RS
	ON RS.issued_id = IST.issued_id
JOIN books AS b
	ON b.isbn = iST.issued_book_isbn
WHERE return_date IS NULL 
	AND CURRENT_DATE - (iST.issued_date + INTERVAL '30 Days')::DATE > 0
GROUP BY 1,2;

```
